            <p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><span data-contrast="auto">This semester, I learned
                    multiple things.&nbsp;Many were more minor or served to remind me of things I learned in previous English
                    classes. A lot of the assignments we did were very similar to assignments from English 1301&mdash;those worked
                    to reinforce concepts I was already familiar with. Last semester, we planned our research projects in a very
                    similar way to how we did this semester; both research projects started out with a similar brainstorming process
                    which involved re-reading the same content about research and &ldquo;positionality,&rdquo; coming up with a line
                    of inquiry, and beginning to find sources for our essays. However, one of the more useful tools that we learned
                    about this semester was the mind-map. In contrast to the brain-dump we did last semester, the structure of the
                    mind-map was very helpful in all of the parts of composing the paper: in the research process, it was helpful to
                    keep on track with the parts of my inquiry that were important; in the writing it helped me to structure the
                    paper and build out a basic outline, and during revision, it helped me to figure out what to keep and remove
                    and/or how to modify what I had in order to improve the flow of the paper.</span><span

            </p>
            <p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><span data-contrast="auto">I think that one of the
                    more valuable things I learned this semester was from the remix project. I have already written numerous papers
                    and essays, and with that writing comes research. Even though there is always&nbsp;room for improvement, I do
                    generally know how to find sources. A skill that is rather new to me, though, is remixing. As I noted in my last
                    reflection, I don&rsquo;t think I fully understood the remix project last semester in ENGL 1301, and because of
                    that I didn&rsquo;t put as much effort into it as I could have. As a result, it wasn&rsquo;t very engaging to my
                    target audience. This semester, I think that my remix project was of a higher quality, and based on feedback
                    from my peers (who are also my target audience), it is an engaging format. I don&rsquo;t know anybody my age who
                    would curl up with an academic research paper on the effect of multimedia on languages and just read it unless
                    they had to. However, in some of the feedback I received for my artifact project, the way I delivered my message
                    (in a much more casual format than a paper) actually made them excited about the topic, and they wanted to learn
                    more... I would call that a successful project remix.&nbsp;</span><span

                    my remix project, but I think it was worth it, because I learned how to take the important information from one
                    format and repurpose it into a new form, one that a demographically different audience would find interesting.
                    The audience for my paper was&nbsp;you, a professor, so it was academic. The audience for my remix project was
                    my peers, so it took on a much more casual form, which worked well for both the context and the content of the
                    information. I think the ability to remix a message from one form to another depending on who I need to
                    communicate with will be an important life skill for later classes I take, as well as for my future
                    jobs.&nbsp;</span><span

                    &ldquo;translate&rdquo; (or remix) information from the other techies to the customer, who is very rarely as
                    familiar with all of the technical bits. What I learned in this class will hopefully act as a foundation to
                    build upon that skill, which would be valuable to future employers, and even in non-work

                <p><span data-contrast="none">Last semester I did a pretty poor job on my remix project; I didn&rsquo;t put as much
                        effort in, and I don&rsquo;t think I really understood what the goal of the assignment was. Last semester my
                        train of thought was &ldquo;this is an English class, I am here to write essays,&rdquo; because that is what
                        English classes are all about in high school. Of course, ENGL 1301-1302 does have a lot of assignments that have
                        to do with research and essay writing, but that isn&rsquo;t the sole purpose of an English class. What I learned
                        from this semester, and more specifically from this project is how to tailor my message to an audience. Writing
                        academically is a very important skill to have, but only a very few people will sit down with a five-page
                        research paper and just casually read it. The purpose of the remix project was to transform the important
                        information from a paper that many people will have no interest in, into a new form that is targeted at a specific
                        audience.</span><span

                <p><span data-contrast="none">My writing process is rather different from my creation process. When I am writing a paper, I spend a lot of time figuring out what information is
                        important for my paper. I spend a lot of time researching the topic before I even start writing. When I do start
                        to write, I go many paragraphs at a time with only minimal tweaking before going back to review and revise my
                        writing. In contrast, when I am coding (which is how I made my artifact), I rarely make proper plans ahead of
                        time, and sort of just dive right in. While I am working on a project like my remix project, I am very
                        perfectionist, if possible, making sure that each block of code is right before moving on. Unless I am under a
                        time constraint, I can spend a large amount of time on small sections of code, revising, and sometimes rewriting
                        before I move on to write another section.</span><span

                        on. It is easy to know what I mean, and to gloss over finer details that not everybody necessarily knows; for
                        example, in the feedback discussion board, Josephine gave me some feedback that I originally didn't think twice
                        about: she said I should probably give some more background information about who Martin Luther was, because not
                        every person is familiar with him. Growing up in a Christian house, I am already familiar with Martin Luther,
                        but not everybody is. In addition to that, it is easy for people who aren&rsquo;t familiar with Martin Luther
                        to think I am referring to the equally famous, if not more famous Martin Luther King Jr. In which case, the
                        viewer of my remix project would probably be quite confused.</span><span

                        pre-scripted&nbsp;messages are sent by various characters to convey the message in an interactive form. The
                        medium I used also acted as a further example of the message I was sending through it.</span><span

                        in this case a research paper, and transform it into a completely new form that is made specifically for a new
                        audience is very useful. The main challenge I faced was to decide what genre/form/medium was the best way of
                        getting my message to my target audience. Once I decided to make a fake messaging app, it was a very challenging
                        computer programming project which I had to complete in a limited amount of time. I came across multiple
                        app-breaking and annoying bugs in my project, but with work, those are mostly fixed. My code may be spaghetti
                        code, but it works, and more than likely, you don&rsquo;t care what the code looks like.</span><span

            Note: my research proposal is: "The Effect of Technology on How People Read"

            <p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="" data-darkreader-inline-bgimage="" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent; text-decoration: none; --darkreader-inline-bgimage: initial; --darkreader-inline-bgcolor:transparent;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I am somewhat concerned that I won&rsquo;t be able to find enough research that is mainly focused on reading/writing. There is plenty of research available on how technology affects things like mental health, and sleep schedules, but there research focused on literacy may not be as common.</span></p>
            <p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="" data-darkreader-inline-bgimage="" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; --darkreader-inline-bgimage: initial; --darkreader-inline-bgcolor:transparent;"><br></p>

            <p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="" data-darkreader-inline-bgimage="" style="margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; --darkreader-inline-bgimage: initial; --darkreader-inline-bgcolor:transparent;">I don&rsquo;t think the researching itself is going to be particularly difficult, because I somewhat enjoy research on topics that interest me, which this one does; however, I do have a problem of going down research &ldquo;rabbit holes,&rdquo; and becoming laser focused on a single topic that may only be mildy related to the actual topic of my paper. Going down a rabbit hole is something I need to avoid, and might prove to be a difficulty in for this project.</p>

I haven&rsquo;t done enough research into the topic yet to determine if overall technology has a positive or negative effect on our ability to read and absorb information. Although I remember last semester I didn&rsquo;t have a completely clear picture of how my research paper would look like when it was complete, but it turned out well; as I continued to research my topic last semester, I had to slightly modify my inquiry to better fit what I learned.</p>

Do you text? Do you use any kind of social media? Do you read menus and order lunch? &hellip; <span style="text-decoration: none;">Language is an incredibly important part of our lives.&nbsp;&rdquo; partially inspired my research topic. While I was reading that, I thought &ldquo;of course,&rdquo; and the main thing that stood out to me was the parts about technology related communication, which is ever present in our world, especially since Covid 19 pushed schools towards online classes like this one.</span></p>

That is, do you switch from one language to another? Or one way of speaking to another? What are the moments/thoughts/cues that trigger this switching? Why do you do it?</strong></p>
            <p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="" data-darkreader-inline-bgimage="" style="margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 100%; background: transparent; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; --darkreader-inline-bgimage: initial; --darkreader-inline-bgcolor:transparent;">Yes, I do. When I am writing a paper for a professor, I use formal language, when I am talking to strangers, I tend to use slightly more formal language than I might if I was talking to a friend or family member, and of course when I am texting, grammar and punctuation, and not-abbreviating are thrown out the window.</p>

It is also a good idea to teach that language isn&rsquo;t a static entity, it has always changed, and likely always will. Although I understand the authors point of view that argues that Academic English can marginalize students who aren&rsquo;t native born English speakers, and I would agree that in some cases it does, I think it does make sense to have a relatively standardized system for&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">written communication</span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;with other English speakers.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Having said that, I don&rsquo;t think teachers should uphold Academic English as the one and only gold standard of writing in the classroom.</span></span></p>
