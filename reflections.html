                <br><br><em>Prompt: What GOALS do you have for yourself this semester? Of course you want to pass/get a good grade…but what else?</em><br>

                I would like to get better at writing, both academic/research writing, and maybe, learn how to write good notes for people, because I just am not good at doing that.
                
                <br><br><em>Prompt: When you leave this class, what do you want to KNOW? What do you want to be able to DO?</em><br>
                
                I would like to know how to put together an excellent essay for any subject by means of research, flow, reader retention, etc.
                
                <br><br><em>Prompt: Is there anything you’re interested or excited to get from our time together?</em><br>
                From what I have already read, I am excited by the "philosophy" of writing. Based on the assigned reading, this course looks to be alot more interesting than simply giving outlines and templates for different types of literature or writing.
                
                I also am excited about the portfolio, it seems like a cool idea.

                Reflection 2.1
            </h3>
            <h5>8.10.2020</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I am really sorry that this reflection is late, having the class go offline really threw things off.
                <br><br><em>Prompt: What links have you discovered between your identities and literacy practices?</em><br>
                Something that came up alot this week in both the readings and in the group project was the fact that everyone uses different forms language depending on their circumstances. I found that both intersting, and true, and I hadn't really thought about that before.
                
                <br><br><em>Prompt: Have you experienced moments of community, isolation, or confusion in your literacy history?</em><br>
                When I write academically, either an essay, or something smaller like this reflection, I work alone, so I definitely don't have a sense of community, but I am also not isolated, because I can ask family members to review it and help check for mistakes that I may not have noticed. Although I may not get confused when writing something academic, I often can get lost, or have a brain freeze which stops me from writing. <br>When I write or talk to a friend, it is far more casual, and I suppose it does give a sense of a mini (2 person) community.
