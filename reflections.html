            <hr>
            <p><strong>Isolate two or three comments that you received (even if they're comments within comments) that you found particularly impactful and helpful to you on your composing journey or even as a writer? </strong></p>
            <p>Instead of just isolating two individual comments, I will find two themes that came up in multiple comments, because multiple people recommended the same thing. In general people seem to think that my argument and conclusion are good, so their suggestions focused on the video itself.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Make the introduction more interesting to grab the viewer&rsquo;s attention.</li>
            <li>Add background music to the video</li>
            <li>Make the font bigger/different color to make it easier to view</li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Why are these comments effective? What about them, specifically, did you find very helpful? How do you intend to apply them?</strong></p>
            <p>The main purpose of these comments is to make the video more engaging to the audience. Each of the suggestions was helpful and specific, for example making the color/font contrast more with the background. I will look for a good ambient music track to play in the background, and experiment with the colors until I find something that contrasts well.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Like the previous question, do the same but this isolate two or three comments that you found particularly ineffective. Why were these not as helpful? What do you think the commenter misread or misinterpreted in your project? Is there a reason you can think of why the comment was posted? In evaluating these comments, what does it teach you about peer review and the way that you formulated comments for your peers?</strong></p>
            <p>I can&rsquo;t find any unhelpful feedback, everything I got was useful and I will consider when revising and finishing my animation. If anything, the responses may have lacked specific constructive criticism when it comes to my actual arguments and conclusion.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Upon weighing and evaluating the feedback received, where do you go from here? How are you taking the comments and applying them to your research project? What changes will you specifically be making in the next draft of your artifact?</strong></p>
            <p>I will finish my video and revise other parts of it. I will try to take into account all of the suggestions I got because they were all helpful. Specifically, I will make fonts clearer, tweak colors for better contrast, and add more supporting information. I will add background music and try to make the introduction grab the viewer&rsquo;s attention (as best as possible while talking about school).</p>
            <p><strong>As a general overview of your feedback received, what have you learned about your own learning, creating, and composing process? How do you know you've learned this? What comments that you received key into this new insight you have?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>I wish I had received more feedback on my message itself, however, I have learned that it is helpful to pass your work by other people, because they might come up with something I completely forgot about; I forgot about music, but now that it was mentioned, it seems obvious.</p>

                Reflection 3.5
            </h3>
            <h5>10.24.2020</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                <br><br><em>Prompt: What was the overall effect of the feedback-based revisions you made to your draft?</em><br>
                I think overall, I tried to make sentences clearer, and I rewrote run-on sentences. Unfortunately, one of my classmates never responded to with feedback, and one of my classmates, while offering some helpful feedback, and answering my questions well, wasn’t able to provide¬ as much critical feedback as I would have preferred. So, I only had one response with adequate feedback that helped me when revising, which may be either a good or bad thing, it might be good in the sense that one of my classmates liked the state my essay was already in, meaning minimal revision was required, or, it could be that since I didn’t receive as much feedback as some other groups were able to give/receive, that I missed something important in my revision.
                <br><br><em>Prompt: What are some characteristics about the feedback that helped you the most? The least?</em><br>
                I thought that the self-assessment was a really good system to test my own work with, of course I always go back over my own drafts and look for things to improve upon, but the self-assessment dimensions were helpful to narrow down what should be improved. Coming up with two custom dimensions was also useful for me to think about the overall essay and what areas might need improvement that the other four dimensions didn’t cover.
                <br><br><em>Prompt: How was revision based on feedback from peers different from revision based on self-feedback?</em><br>
                Peer feedback is helpful because it allows you to get a little bit of information on how other people perceive the words you wrote, and they can catch things you might miss. For example, while reading over my own draft, I might miss a typo because I know what I was trying to say, and my mind “auto-completes”, but other readers will catch that.

            </h3>
            <h5>10.18.2020</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                <br><br><em>Prompt: How was your peer feedback experience similar to and different from your past experiences?</em><br>
                Previously, most assignments have been graded and reviewed only by my teachers, so having peers give feedback should prove to be interesting. At the time of writing, I have not received feedback from two of my group, and it is already close to the deadline, so I am not going to wait any longer. I really liked the self-assessment using different dimensions, but I struggled with the risk-taking dimension, because I wrote my first draft in a fairly standard essay format, which is how I expect to have to write essays, and I don’t know what kind of risks you expect us to take.
                <br><br><em>Prompt: What was your experience like crafting constructive responses to your peers' work?</em><br>
                It was interesting to read the different lines of inquiry, the essays I responded to were both very interesting and came to a logical conclusion. I did my best to address each of the dimensions, stating whether or not I agreed with the author’s self-assessment, and explaining why if I didn’t. I also made sure to think through the questions the authors asked and understand what they wanted in response them before I tried answering; whether or not I did a good job will be up to them.
                <br><br><em>Prompt: What kind of impact did receiving peer feedback have on your revision ideas?</em><br>
                One of my classmates has responded at this point, and they essentially just said great job, they broke down my self-assessment, and answered my questions. I was worried I may not have been on the right track, but according to the feedback I have so far received, my draft was interesting to read, and my representation of my sources and different modes of education were well represented.
I would say that is a score.

                Reflection 3.1
            </h3>
            <h5>9.20.2020</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                <br><br><em>Prompt: Where do you think good and bad ideas come from?</em><br>
                The simple answer would be your brain, but it is more complicated than that. Ideas can come from conversations, from brainstorming, from epiphanies. 

                <br><br><em>Prompt: What would you say is the connection between questions and ideas?</em><br>
                I agree with the way Steven Johnson put it in his TED talk; an idea is a network. Not just a physical network, but a network of thoughts or questions that combine to create a new idea. When people think about a problem, they often ask questions, and those questions form into a network that can result in a sudden discovery, a culmination of many thoughts connecting, an idea.

                <br><br><em>Prompt: Describe the last time you were really curious about something? What motivated that curiosity? What did you do about it?</em><br>
                The most recent thing that I have been curious about it how 3D graphics work, mainly, the math behind them and how to implement that math efficiently. I think the main thing that motivated that curiosity is playing video games, and wanting to learn more about how they work so that I can build my own games; and, it is just an interesting topic to learn about. Since this is still a curiosity of mine, and it isn’t something I can just learn in one day, I am still researching it, watching videos about it, and experimenting with it.

                Reflection 2.2
            </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                <br><br><em>Prompt: Which texts -- whether they were complete texts or just excerpts -- and videos were especially meaningful for you during this series? What kind of impact did they have on you?</em><br>
                In the excerpt Some People are Just Born Good Writers, the quote “By seeing authors as genius artists only, we remove ourselves from the activity of writing”, the author made a good point. Even though the author's point wasn’t new information for me, it is still true, and I think most people at some point will think that they can’t write because they don’t experience “brilliant epiphanies”, even if they can.

                <br><br><em>Prompt: Overall, what are you thinking about language and identity and the way language and identity are (or are not) intertwined? What did you find particularly challenging or interesting about this?</em><br>
                The language or languages you speak are definitely tied to identity, just like the country or state you live in is a large part of your identity. This is something I had already thought about, but this reflection prompt made me think about it a little more. I as a native English speaker, and only an English speaker think in English, thinking is so deeply tied to our identities, that I don’t know if much else could be closer. One thing I have been curious about is if multilingual people who think in their native language, start learning another language and begin using it more often than their old language, do they start thinking in that new language, or so they think in a hybrid? That is a question I would like to know the answer to, and I think it is a good example of how language relates to our identity.

            <h5>8.10.2020</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I am really sorry that this reflection is late, having the class go offline really threw things off.
                <br><br><em>Prompt: What links have you discovered between your identities and literacy practices?</em><br>
                Something that came up a lot this week in both the readings and in the group project was the fact that everyone uses different forms language depending on their circumstances. I found that both interesting, and true, and I hadn't really thought about that before. 
                
                <br><br><em>Prompt: Have you experienced moments of community, isolation, or confusion in your literacy history?</em><br>
                When I write academically, either an essay, or something smaller like this reflection, I work alone, so I definitely don't have a sense of community, but I am also not isolated, because I can ask family members to review it and help check for mistakes that I may not have noticed. Although I may not get confused when writing something academic, I often can get lost, or have a brain freeze which stops me from writing.<br>When I write or talk to a friend, it is far more casual, and I suppose it does give a sense of a mini (2 person) community.

            <p>
                <br><br><em>Prompt: What GOALS do you have for yourself this semester? Of course you want to pass/get a good grade…but what else?</em><br>

                I would like to get better at writing, both academic/research writing, and maybe, learn how to write good notes for people, because I just am not good at doing that.
                
                <br><br><em>Prompt: When you leave this class, what do you want to KNOW? What do you want to be able to DO?</em><br>
                
                I would like to know how to put together an excellent essay for any subject by means of research, flow, reader retention, etc.
                
                <br><br><em>Prompt: Is there anything you’re interested or excited to get from our time together?</em><br>
                From what I have already read, I am excited by the "philosophy" of writing. Based on the assigned reading, this course looks to be alot more interesting than simply giving outlines and templates for different types of literature or writing.
                
                I also am excited about the portfolio, it seems like a cool idea.
